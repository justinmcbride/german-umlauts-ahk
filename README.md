# Typing German Umlauts on Windows

This is an AutoHotKey script that enables easily typing German umaluted letters using an English layout keyboard.

## Running the Script
You have multiple options:
1. Download the `.ahk` file, and run that directly in AutoHotKey.
2. Download the pre-compiled executable and run that. This was built on GitHub's servers, using the in-repository GitHub Actions workflow. The executable should be under the Releases section of this repository.

I would suggest the second method, as it is easist.

## Usage and Typing the Characters
It's extremely simple to use. You hold the Caps Lock key down, and then press the character that you want with an umlaut.

For example:
- To type `ä`: simply hold `Caps Lock`, and press the `a` key.
- To type `Ä`: simply hold `Caps Lock` **and** `Shift`, and press the `a` key.

## Notice!
This script hijacks the `Caps Lock` key. You can no longer toggle it on/off while this script is active. I consider this an extra feature, but your opinion may vary!
